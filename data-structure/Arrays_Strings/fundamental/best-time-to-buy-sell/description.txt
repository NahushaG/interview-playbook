Problem Description: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
===================================================================================

You are given an array where each element represents the price of a given stock on that day. Your goal is to determine the maximum profit you can achieve from a single buy and sell operation. Note that you must buy before you can sell.

===================================================================================
Variant 1: Single Transaction (LC-121)
===================================================================================
Find the maximum profit you can achieve from exactly one transaction (buy once and sell once).

Example:
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.

===================================================================================
Variant 2: Unlimited Transactions (LC-122)
===================================================================================
You can complete as many transactions as you like (buy and sell multiple times), but you must sell the stock before you buy again.

Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1), sell on day 5 (price = 5), total profit = 5 - 1 = 4. You could also sell each day and buy the next to achieve the same result.

===================================================================================
Variant 3: At Most K Transactions (LC-188)
===================================================================================
You are allowed to complete at most two transactions.

Example:
Input: [3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4]
       K=2
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0), sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3 - 0 = 3. Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4 - 1 = 3. Total profit = 3 + 3 = 6.

===================================================================================
Variant 4: Cooldown Period (LC-309)
=================================================================================== 
You can complete as many transactions as you like, but after you sell a stock, you must wait one day before you can buy again.

Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1), sell on day 2 (price = 2), profit = 1. Cooldown on day 3. Then buy on day 4 (price = 0), sell on day 5 (price = 2), profit = 2. Total profit = 1 + 2 = 3.
