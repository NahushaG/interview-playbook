# Trick to solve the problem 
- Understand the Problem
    - Read carefully: Ensure you understand exactly what's being asked
    - Identify input and output: Clarify the type, size and constraints of input
    - Ask clarifying question 
        - Are inputs sorted?
        - Can there be duplicates
        - Are negative number allowed
    - Example: Find the longest substring without repeating characters
        - Input : String s
        - Output: integer(length)
        - Constraints: ASCII characters, string length <= 10^5
- Identify Constraints & Edge Cases
    - Constraints often hint at time/space complexity requirements
        - Small N -> O(n2) may be fine
        - Large N -> O(NlogN) or O(N) expected
    - Edge cases to consider
        - Empty input
        - Single element
        - Maximum/Minimum values
    - Example: Empty string or string with all identical characters
- Spot the Pattern
    - Look for structural clues in the problemc:
        - Continuous elements - Sliding Window / Two pointer
        - Graph/ relationships - BFS / DFS/ Union-Find
        - Combinations/ Permutations - Backtracking / Recursion
        - Max/Min / Top-K - Heap/ Priority queue
        - Overlapping subproblems - Sliding window pattern
    - Example: Longest substring - Sliding window pattern
- Choose a suitable Data Structure/Algorithim
    - Based on the identified pattern, pick the right tools:
        - Arrays, Strings - Two pointer , sliding window
        - Trees - BFS/DFS
        - Graph - Adjacency list/ matrix, BFS/DFS
        - Frequent elements - HashMap + Heap
    - Always justify your choice in the interview
- Estimate Time & Space Complexity
    - Check if your approach fits within constraints 
    - Trade-offs: Sometimes a slightly slower but simpler solution is acceptable initially
    - Example: Sliding window - O(N) time 0(K) space
- Plan Before Coding
    - High-level steps: Explain your approach in 2-3 sentences
    - Example - Iâ€™ll use a sliding window with two pointers. Maintain a hashmap to track character frequency and expand/shrink the window to find the longest substring without repeats.
- Validate With Examples
    - Test small examples manually before coding
        - Normal case
        - Edge case
        - Large input case
- Summary
